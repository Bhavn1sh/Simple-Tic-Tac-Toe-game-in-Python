    <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game Instructions</h1>
    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe, the classic 3x3 grid game! The game is played between two players, 
            <span class="highlight">Player O</span> and <span class="highlight">Player X</span>, who take turns to 
            place their respective marks ('O' or 'X') in an empty spot on the board.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the game is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
            Here's how to play:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Step 1:</span> The game board is a 3x3 grid.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Step 2:</span> Player O and Player X take turns placing their marks.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Step 3:</span> To make a move, choose a number between 1 and 9 that corresponds to an empty spot on the grid. For example, 1 corresponds to the top-left corner, and 9 corresponds to the bottom-right corner.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Step 4:</span> The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins!</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Step 5:</span> If the grid is full and no one has won, the game ends in a tie.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Winning Conditions</h2>
        <p>The winner is the first player to align three marks in a row, either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Horizontally: 3 marks in any row (e.g., positions 1, 2, 3).</li>
            <li>Vertically: 3 marks in any column (e.g., positions 1, 4, 7).</li>
            <li>Diagonally: 3 marks in any diagonal (e.g., positions 1, 5, 9).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Game Board</h2>
        <p>Hereâ€™s an example of how the Tic-Tac-Toe board looks:</p>
        <pre>
          1 | 2 | 3
         ---+---+---
          4 | 5 | 6
         ---+---+---
          7 | 8 | 9
        </pre>
        <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The game ends when one player wins or when all spots are filled (tie).</li>
            <li>If a player tries to pick a spot that's already taken, they must choose another empty spot.</li>
            <li>There is no time limit for making a move. Take your time and think carefully!</li>
        </ul>
